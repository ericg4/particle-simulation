# Particle Simulation

A real-time particle physics simulation built with SFML 3.x and C++. Features rainbow-colored particles with realistic gravity, mouse-controlled emission, and performance monitoring.

## Features

### ðŸŒˆ Visual Effects
- **Rainbow particle colors** - Particles cycle through the entire color spectrum
- **Smooth 60 FPS rendering** with real-time performance metrics
- **Oscillating emission patterns** - Particles spray in animated fan patterns

### âš¡ Realistic Physics
- **Gravity simulation** with proper acceleration physics
- **Mass-based dynamics** - Different particle masses for varied behavior
- **Air resistance/drag** for natural terminal velocity
- **Force-based physics system** using F = ma

### ðŸŽ® Interactive Controls
- **Mouse-controlled emitter** - Particles follow your cursor
- **Click and hold** - Continuous particle emission while mouse button pressed
- **ESC key** - Exit the simulation

### ðŸ“Š Performance Monitoring
- **Real-time FPS display**
- **Frame time monitoring** (milliseconds per frame)
- **Active particle count**

## Dependencies

- **SFML 3.x** - Graphics and window management
- **CMake 3.16+** - Build system
- **C++17 compiler** (GCC, Clang, or MSVC)

## Installation

### macOS
```bash
# Install SFML via Homebrew
brew install sfml
```

## Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ericg4/particle-simulation.git
cd particle_simulation

# Create build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Generate build files
cmake ..

# Compile
make

# Run the simulation
./particle_simulation
```

## Usage

### Controls
- **Mouse Movement** - Controls particle emitter position
- **Left Mouse Button (Hold)** - Emit particles continuously
- **ESC Key** - Exit simulation

### Features in Action
- Particles spray downward with realistic gravity
- Emission angle oscillates left-to-right over time
- Colors cycle through rainbow spectrum
- Physics simulate mass, drag, and acceleration

## Technical Details

### Physics System
- **Acceleration-based physics** with proper force integration
- **Gravity constant**: 500 pixels/secondÂ²
- **Drag coefficient**: 0.98 (2% velocity loss per frame)

### Rendering
- **HSV to RGB color conversion** for smooth rainbow transitions
- **Real-time performance metrics** displayed on screen
- **Efficient particle cleanup** (removes off-screen/dead particles)

### Performance
- **Target**: 60 FPS with hundreds of active particles
- **Optimizations**: Vector-based particle storage, efficient collision detection
- **Memory management**: Automatic cleanup of expired particles
